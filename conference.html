            <p>ICISGâ€™22 has emerged as an enduring techno-platform to connect education experts and
                passionate educators all
                over the world for improving the potential for excellence in engineering education. It provides a
                premier
                interdisciplinary forum for researchers, engineers and academicians to present and discuss the most
                recent
                trends, innovations, concerns, practical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted for
                Sustainable
                development and Green Environment. The conference also focuses on mutually sharing the advances and
                innovative technologies for the scientists, scholars, engineers and students from different universities
                and
                industry to present ongoing research activities, focused on solutions to achieve the Sustainable
                Development
                Goals (SDGs) and hence to foster collaborations among stakeholders and researchers from distinct
                universities, national laboratories, government funding bodies and the industry.</p>

        <h4 class="text-pink">Scope of the <span class="text-info">Conference </span></h4>
        <p>Sustainable development is the idea that human societies must live and meet their needs without
            compromising
            the ability of future generations. Sustainable development is a way of organizing society so that it can
            exist in the long term. This means taking into account both the imperatives present and those of the
            future,
            such as the preservation of the environment and natural resources or social and economic equity. Much
            efforts are needed from researchers to achieve SDGs and clear need to â€˜go beyondâ€™. This Conference aims
            to
            gain valuable insights and contributions from researchers and practitioners facilitating
            interdisciplinary
            perspectives. Depleting resources & rising pollution levels coupled with devastating climate changes
            have
            been affecting our planet severely. Scientists, activists & common people are calling for a need to
            maintain
            a Green environment & preserve our Earth. It is high time to go green!</p>
